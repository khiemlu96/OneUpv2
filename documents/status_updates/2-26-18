### 2-26-18 Status Update

Last week we completed front-end routing and begun implemeting json web tokens for authentication. We may also decide to not use passport.js.

This week we will rebuild our modals using new npm packages for a specific react bootstrap modal.

Problems: Possible errors with JWT and also lack of documentation for certain custom modals we are looking to use.
