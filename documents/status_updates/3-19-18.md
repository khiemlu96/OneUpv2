### 3-19-18 Status Update

Last week we switched reverted back to passport.js and got multiple sign ins to work with correct redirecting. However, there are some small issues that cause a user to login twice before changes actually happen (problems with asynchronous vs synchronous).

This week we will try to fix this error, but also go back to focusing on frontend components (still modals) and different components for video playing

Problems: Making slow progress with each problem. May need to ask for further help with the synchronous vs asynchronous problems
