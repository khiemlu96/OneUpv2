### 1-15-18 Week 2 Status Update

Last week we officially decided to continue with OneUp and make some changes on our team. We created a new repo (may move back to the old one), and are reviewing where we left off and what needs to be done.

This week we will put together an indepth timeline and checklist for what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by. We will split these roles between the two of us and plan when to meet.

Overall, there are not many problems yet, but can see some possible challenges in the near future with what we were unable to accomplish last semester.
