### 2-12-18 Week 6 Status Update

Last week we begun restructuring our routing of components. It's a slow process with trying to re-route everything and relearn things that we forgot. We are making slow progress, and have not had to reach out for help, yet.

This week we will continue with this, but also get started on some front end components that just require cleaning up. The modal is the biggest front end problem we have and will be tackles this week.

Problems - The problems we run into are difficult and take a while, but there haven't been any total roadblocks.
