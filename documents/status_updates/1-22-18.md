### 1-22-18 Week 3 Status Update

Last week we put together a tentative schedule/timeline of when we need to get things done by. We spent an hour or so going in depth on our web app to see what else we need to have a completed website. It was reassuring to see that the bulk of structure of the site has been set up, but just needs to be flushed out. 

This week we will begin tackling our first problem dealing with the backend structure. We have allocated more time to this task seeing that we may have to restructure some of our code. It does not handle multiple users well/efficiently and should be redone. We suspect where the problem lies and will get going on fixing it.

Problems we are encountering is where this backend error lies and how much we needs to change to fix it. As mentioned, we have several ideas to where it went wrong, but must get it figured out.
