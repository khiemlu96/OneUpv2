### 3-5-18 Status Update

Last week we implemented jwt for our sign in but running into a problem in which the user has to sign in twice. 

This week we need to compare url with payloads from jwt to authenticate/redirect users to certain pages.

Problems: We're not sure how to compare url with payload information, and are struggling to confirm our methods are being approached correctly.
