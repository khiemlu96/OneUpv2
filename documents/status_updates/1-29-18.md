### 1-29-18 Week 4 Status Update

Last week we narrowed down our problem regarding the backend structure, but have not completely figured out the exact fix. We began working on front-end components that needed tidying up as well.

This week we will continue to figure out the backend problem and reach out to people who can confirm what is wrong. We are also workonig on the front-end -- specifically the upvoting feature that needs to be able to read upvotes for each user and only allow one upvote/downvote per person. The site does not do this, and is an essential feature.

We still have the same problem with the backend, but should be able to figure out the upvoting/downvoting feature. It requires the backend to read an upvote/downvote from each user, so this might have to be done after we fix our backend server.
