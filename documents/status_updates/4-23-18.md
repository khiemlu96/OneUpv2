### 4-23-18 Status Update

Last week we spent a lot of time working on displaying upvoted videos because that requires restructuring out backend and how it stores videos that are upvoted by each user. However, we know how to approach it and just need to keep working at it. Exact same scenario with separating videos by week.

This week we hope to finish these tasks and wrap up the site. Thers only small thigns left such as logging out, deleting videos, and smaller components.

Problems: Small problems with separating videos by week and time crunch now, but we are working on it!
