### 2-19-18 Week 7 Status Update

Last week we took a break from the backend while reaching out to someone with experience with the MERN stack who we are waiting for advice from. Instead we started to tackle front end problems and design issues.

This week we will continue with the backend and and frontend components. At this point, we are trying to get the backend tucked away so we can have a working server for multiple users. 

Problems - Same issues since the beginning, but making small breakthroughs evevry week.
