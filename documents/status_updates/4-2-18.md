### 4-2-18 Status Update

Last week we spent a lot of time on the upvoting components and trying different npm packages that make this easier. It's been a bit difficult, but we are narrowing down the possibilities. 

This week we will hope to finish upvoting and begin finalizing components (design-wise) for the presentation next week

Problems: Not many big issues except for the typical ones we've been talking about but slowly narrowing down.
