### 3-26-18 Status Update

Last week we mainly worked on front end components but are beginning to tackle upvoting/downvoting so that a user can only upvote/downvote once

This week we will continue with upvoting/downvoting and make sure the voting count is getting saved to the database respective to each user. 

Problems: Same problems still with asynchronous vs synchronous and also making sure voting component runs smoothly and takes in only one count. Pretty sure we can figure these out, for now.
