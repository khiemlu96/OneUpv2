### 4-16-18 Status Update

Last week we completed all modal designs, but are still working on the upvoting/downvoting component to limit one per person. We also successfully displayed 'Uploaded Videos' on the user profile.

This week we have to display 'Upvoted Videos' on the user profile. We also want to work on categorizing the videos by week and giving a date to each video uploaded.

Problems: Still the upvoting downvoting component, and some small front end bugs regarding modals.
