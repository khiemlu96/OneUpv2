### 2-5-18 Week 5 Status Update

Last week we figured that our components were not rendering efficiently and everything is being done as server-side rendering rather than some react routing in the front end. This could help us facilitate multiple user requests better, so we are working on restructuring this and finding the right tools/ways to do so.

This week we will continue with this error and stay focused on it. We can't get to the voting functions without it.

Problems - It's looking better now, but still have much work to do. Also will need to reach out for help from other people if this problem persists any longer.
